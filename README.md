# Pretrained_Models_on_CIFAR_for_Pytorch
I'll share a link contains pretrained models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 & upload results.

Many pretrained Models are in [Here](https://github.com/chenyaofo/pytorch-cifar-models) too, and I trained models which aren't uploaded.

# CIFAR-100
I trained models on CIFAR-100 from [HERE](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100).

You can download all the models below in [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160e5v6RJ9EPJhW6I80RaDSugax2h-Uud?usp=sharing).
